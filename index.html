      <p> 
	  The Shin Megami Tensei games are a series of RPGs I will forever hold close to my heart. 
	  Featuring figures from myths and legends across the globe, 
	  they combine my love of video games and mythology in just the right way. <br>
	  <br>
	  On this website I'd normally take the time to go over a few of the designs seen throughout the series 
	  compared with a more classical depiction of the same figure. With one page featuring designs 
	  based on Eastern myths and legends, and the other will show designs based on Western myths and legends. 
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  However, the website is currently under renovations as it were, so the links to the other pages aren't currently working. 
	  Nor are the other pages available. To account for this, this page will talk about a few myths from both the East and the West, 
	  and show a design from one of the Western myths that was covered on another page. Additionally there will be an image gallery 
	  at the bottom displaying the SMT Designs of <b>Jack Frost (SMT5)</b>, <b>Jack O Frost (Megami Tensei 2)</b>, <b>King Frost (SMT2)</b>, 
	  <b>Frost Ace (SMT Imagine)</b>, and <b>Pyro Jack (Soul Hackers)</b>, in that specific order. There will also be the option to play a 
	  special version of the song "Triangulum" from SMT:DS2 in the footer of the page, so that you can enjoy it while browsing this page. 
	  This song is one of my personal favorites so I definitely recomend giving it a listen, and I really hope you enjoy it.<br>
	  <br>
	  <h4>(NOTE: The website is not actually under renovations, this is just a clever little explaination for why this project uses resources 
	  from the first project, while not actually linking to its pages.)</h4> <br>
	  
	  <h4>(NOTE: I do not own the images or music used in this school project.)</h4> <br>

				<td> 
				  Here we have Fionn mac Cumhaill (can be pronounced "Finn MacCool"). He was warrior-hunter who 
				  appeared in Irish Mythology. Among his many tales, it's said that he never died, but rather that he slumbers in
				  a cave surrounded by his followers, the Fianna, and will awaken to defend Ireland in it's greatest hour of need.

				<th> Eastern Myth </th>
				<th> Minamoto no Yoshitsune </th>
				<th> Origin: Japan </th>
				<th> Year of Debut in Series: 1995 </th>
				<td>
				  Finally is the famous military commander of the Minamoto clan, Minamoto no Yoshitsune.
				  Despite being an actual historic figure, he has his fair share of myths and legends about him. One such
				  tale states that he was trained being known as a Kurama Tengu, while staying at the Kurama Temple. His
				  design has a great resemblance to many historical depictions of him. He made his series debut back in 
				  1995, making him tied with Shiisaa and the Western urban legend Mothman, for the second oldest SMT designs
				  shown on this website's tables.
				</td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<th> Eastern Myth </th>
				<th> Shiisaa </th>
				<th> Origin: Japan, Okinawa Prefecture </th>
				<th> Year of Debut in Series: 1995 </th>
				<td>
				  Next up is Shiisaa, a Japanese protective spirit appearing in the myths of the Okinawa Prefecture. 
				  Statues of them are often palced on rooftops or flanking the gates of homes. While similar to the Komainu 
				  ("lion dogs"), the biggest difference is that they're smaller and more dog sized.

					  Point Pleasent, West Virginia, between the years of 1966 and 1967. Out of the designs shown on this website, 
					  SMT Mothman has the biggest difference between it and it's depiction in myth, looking noticeably friendlier.
